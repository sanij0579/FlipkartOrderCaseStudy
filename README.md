# ðŸš¨ Hidden Risk in Order Placement Flow â€“ Flipkart Case Study ðŸ›’

## Overview
While placing orders on Flipkart, I observed that many users mistakenly enter **incorrect mobile numbers** while saving their delivery address. This creates serious issues:  

- ðŸ”¹ Delivery boys or even customers can misuse wrong numbers  
- ðŸ”¹ Orders often get canceled due to unreachable numbers  
- ðŸ”¹ Leads to poor user experience and trust issues

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
As a developer passionate about **secure and smooth UX**, I implemented a **simple but powerful solution**:

1. After the address is saved and payment method is selected  
2. ðŸ“² An OTP is sent to the addressâ€™s mobile number  
3. ðŸ§  If verified â€” order is successfully placed  
4. ðŸš« If not â€” user is prompted to correct the number  

> This tiny UX change reduces order failures, minimizes fraud, and enhances delivery success.  
> Small UX improvements can have a **big business impact**, just like minor tweaks in product design can increase profits significantly.
